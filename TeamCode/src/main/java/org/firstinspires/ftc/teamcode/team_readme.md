# Team ReadMe

Welcome to the RoboScorps' repo :>

The repo is organizised as such:
- Testers - Where small and short opmodes made to test a purpose lie when they're unneeded
- Components - Where our programming board is
- Control system - Where all the math related to state and auto are
- mechanisms - where all the functions to move the robot belong.

Nothing should be in the global teamCode unless you want to use it in competition.
Also, when you aren't using an opmode, make sure to disable it.


## TODO
Honesty, it doesn't matter how scuffed the thing is, as long as it works,
no one cares.

TODO Competition prep
[] create a basic auto opmode

TODO Quality of Life
[] figure out how to pid the components of the bot
[] figure out how to use all the libraries that I've installed

TODO refactor
[] Refactor production code into an OpMode class instead of a linear opmode class
[] Refactor defining the hardwaremap into a programming board
[] Throw all the small opmodes into tests in the programming board
