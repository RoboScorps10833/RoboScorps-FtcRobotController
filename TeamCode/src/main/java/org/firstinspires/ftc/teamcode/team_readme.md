# Team ReadMe

Welcome to the RoboScorps' repo :>

The repo is organizised as such:
- Testers - Where small and short opmodes made to test a purpose lie when they're unneeded
- Mechanisms - where all the overhead to move the robot belong.
- Messages - Logs from Roadrunner
- Teleop - This season's teleop stuff
- Autos - This season's autos are
- Tuning - Roadrunner scripts.

Also for group names:
- Drivebase
- Claw
- Lift
Etc... :)

## TODO
Honesty, it doesn't matter how scuffed the thing is, as long as it works,
no one cares.

TODO Competition prep
[] create a basic auto opmode

TODO Quality of Life
[] figure out how to pid the components of the bot
[] figure out how to use all the libraries that I've installed

TODO refactor
[] Refactor production code into an OpMode class instead of a linear opmode class
[] Refactor defining the hardwaremap into a programming board
[] Throw all the small opmodes into tests in the programming board
