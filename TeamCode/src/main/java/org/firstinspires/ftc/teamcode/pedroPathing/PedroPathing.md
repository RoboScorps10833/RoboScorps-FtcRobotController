# Some notes on PedroPathing

Pedropathing is a library for trajectory calculations for FTC robots. 

Notes go here about what the heck we do, as well as a place to put data, constants, or 
other information that might serve useful later, such as PID constants.

Here's the [link](https://pedropathing.com/docs/pathing) if anyone needs it.

## Panels
Panels can act as a more fancy dashboard instead of the driver hub.
You can find it on `192.168.43.1:8001` as a url when connected to the bot via wifi.
